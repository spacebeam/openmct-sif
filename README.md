Open MCT in a Singularity Container

## Possibilities
Open MCT can be adapted for planning and operations of any system that produces telemetry. While the framework is developed to support space missions, its core concepts are not unique to that domain. It can display streaming and historical data, imagery, timelines, procedures, and other data visualizations in one place.

Open MCT could be adapted for applications as diverse as:

- Monitoring of IOT devices
- Drones
- Cubesats
- Robotics
- High altitude balloons
- Electronic health monitoring
- Computer and network performance monitoring
- Enterprise data visualization
- Process control monitoring
