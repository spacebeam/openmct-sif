Open MCT (Mission Control Technologies) in a Singularity Container

## Open MCT
Open MCT is a next-generation mission control framework for visualization of data on desktop and mobile devices.

As a generalizable and open source framework, Open MCT could be used as the basis for building applications for planning, operation, and analysis of any systems producing telemetry data.

Open MCT is designed to support distributed operations, access to data anywhere, data visualization for spacecraft analysis that spans multiple data sources, and flexible reconfiguration to support multiple missions and operator use cases. Open MCT brings together many of the functions of mission operations, alleviating the need for operators to switch between different applications to view all necessary data.

## Possibilities
Open MCT can be adapted for planning and operations of any system that produces telemetry. While the framework is developed to support space missions, its core concepts are not unique to that domain. It can display streaming and historical data, imagery, timelines, procedures, and other data visualizations in one place.

Open MCT could be adapted for applications as diverse as:

- Monitoring of IOT devices
- Drones
- Cubesats
- Robotics
- High altitude balloons
- Electronic health monitoring
- Computer and network performance monitoring
- Enterprise data visualization
- Process control monitoring
